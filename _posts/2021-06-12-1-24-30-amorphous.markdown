"Time present and time past

Are both perhaps present in time future
 
And time future contained in time past

If all time is eternally present 

All time is irredeemable. 

What might have been is an abstraction

Remaining a perpetual possibility

Only in a world of speculation

What might have been and what has been

Point to one end, which is always present."

T.S Eliot
