"All organisms have evolved a mechanism to recognize sensory information in the environment and transmit this information to the brain where it then must be processed to create an internal representation of the external world. 
There are many ways for organisms to probe the external world. Some smell it, others listen to it, many see it. 
Each species therefore lives in its own unique sensory world of which other species may be partially or totally unaware.
A whole series of specific devices alien to human perception have evolved: biosonar in bats, infrared detectors in snakes, electrosensitive organs in fish, and a sensitivity to magnetic fields in birds.
What an organism detects in its environment is only part of what is around it and that part differs in different organisms.
The brain functions, then, not by recording an exact image of the world, but by creating its own selective picture; a picture largely determined by what is important for the survival and reproduction of species.
Sensory impressions, therefore, are apprehended through the lens of the particular perceiving brain and the brain must therefore be endowed with an a priori potential to recognize the sensory world.
Our perceptions are not direct recordings of the world around us, rather they are constructed internally according to  innate rules. Colors, tones, tastes, smells are active constructs created by our brain out of sensory experience.
They do not exist as such outside of sensory experience. Biological reality, I argue, therefore, reflects the particular representation of the external world that a brain is able to build and a brain builds with genes."
