"The sea
Smiles in the distance.
Teeth of foam,
Lips of sky.

What do you sell, O troubled youth,
With your breasts to the wind?

I sell, sir, the water
Of the seas.

What do you carry, O black youth,
Mixed with your blood?

I carry, sir, the water
Of the seas.—

These salty tears,
Oh, Mother, from where do they come?

I weep, sir, the water
Of the seas.—

Heart, and this bitterness
That exists, where was it born?

Very bitter is the water
Of the seas!

The sea
Smiles in the distance.
Foam for its teeth,
The sky for its lips."

by Federico Garcia Lorca

Painting: Impression, Sunrise by Monet
