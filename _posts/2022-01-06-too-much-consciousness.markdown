"I want now to tell you, gentlemen, whether you care to hear it or not, why I could not even become an insect. I tell you solemnly, that I have many times tried to become
an insect. But I was not equal even to that. I swear, gentlemen, that to be too conscious is an illness - a real thorough-going illness. For man's everyday needs it would 
have been quite enough to have the oridinary human consciousness, that is, half or a quarter of the amount which falls to the lot of a cultivated man of our unhappy 
century."

From "Notes from the Underground" by Fyodor Dostoevsky
