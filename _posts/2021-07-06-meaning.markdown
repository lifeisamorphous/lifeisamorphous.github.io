"The closer you get to the meaning, the sooner you'll know that you're dreaming!"

Black Sabath 

"My question, the one that brought me, at the age of fifty, to the verge of suicide, was the simplest of questions, the one that every man carries in the depths of himself, from the stupidest child to the wisest old man - the question without answering which life is impossible, as I indeed experienced. Here is the question: “ what will come of what I do now, of what I wil do tomorrow - What will come of my whole life?” Formulated differently, the question would be the following: “ Why should I live, why desire anything, why do anything?” It can also be put like this: “ Is there meaning in my life that will not be annihilated by the death that inevitably awaits me?” 

Tolstoy
