"Of the many men whom I am, whom we are, 

I cannot settle on a single one. 

They are lost to me under the cover of clothing 

They have departed for another city. 

When everything seems to be set 

to show me off as a man of intelligence,

the fool I keep concealed on my person 

takes over my talk and occupies my mouth. 

On other occasions, I am dozing in the midst 

of people of some distinction, 

and when I summon my courageous self,

a coward completely unknown to me

swaddles my poor skeleton

in a thousand tiny reservations. 

When a stately home bursts into flames, 

instead of the fireman I summon, 

an arsonist bursts on the scene, 

and he is I. There is nothing I can do. 

What must I do to distinguish myself? 

How can I put myself together? 

All the books I read 

lionize dazzling hero figures, 

brimming with self-assurance. 

I die with envy of them; 

and, in films where bullets fly on the wind, 

I am left in envy of the cowboys, 

left admiring even the horses. 

But when I call upon my DASHING BEING, 

out comes the same OLD LAZY SELF, 

and so I never know just WHO I AM, 

nor how many I am, nor WHO WE WILL BE BEING. 

I would like to be able to touch a bell 

and call up my real self, the truly me, 

because if I really need my proper self, 

I must not allow myself to disappear. 

While I am writing, I am far away; 

and when I come back, I have already left. 

I should like to see if the same thing happens 

to other people as it does to me, 

to see if as many people are as I am, 

and if they seem the same way to themselves. 

When this problem has been thoroughly explored, 

I am going to school myself so well in things 

that, when I try to explain my problems, 

I shall speak, not of self, but of geography."

Pablo Neruda
