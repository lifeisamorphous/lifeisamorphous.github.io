The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you can see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes 'awwww!'. 

By Jack Kerouac

About photo: 
This photo was taken by sheer accident during my trip to LA from the top of the Grifith Observatory Hill.
